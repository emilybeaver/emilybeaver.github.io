		<h2>Create space for what matters.</h2>
			<p>Wish your home felt more peaceful and spacious? Do you ever feel overwhelmed by your stuff? I can help. I started So Simple Organized to share what I learned after struggling with years of clutter. As a San Franciscan, I understand the challenges of small, shared, and storage-less living spaces. You don't have to become a minimalist, get rid of everything that doesn't "spark joy," or have a Pinterest-worthy home to enjoy the benefits of living in an orgnaized space. My mission is to make it easy and affordable for you to get organized, no matter what your space is like today.</p>

				<h2>How it works</h2>
				<h3>Step 1: Book a free consultation</h3>
				<p>If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, we'll start wtih 45-minute, judgement-free consultation to review your space and make a plan for organizing that meets your goals.</p>
				<p><a class="button" href="#booking">Book a Consultation </a></p>
			</div>

			<div class="content" id="center">
			<h3>Step 2: Decide Compassionately, Declutter Resposibly</h3>
				<p>Organizing is about deciding what matters to you. We'll decide what to keep. At the end of every session, I'll help you discard unwanted items by donating to charities, helping you sell items online, recycling, or finding another responsible method of disposal.</p> 
				<p><a class="button" href="#">Learn more.</a></p>

			<div class="content" id="right">
			<h3>Step 3: Organize</h3>
				<p>Once your space is clear, I'll help you display and store your items in an effective, attractive way.</p>

		<h2>Pricing</h2>
			<p>I charge by session, a 3-hour block of time. In our consultation, I'll recommend an estimated number of sessions based on your project (the actual time needed to complete your project may vary based on several factors, including how long it takes to make decisions and if you choose to complete work on your own between sessions.)</p>
